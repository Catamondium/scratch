parsing:
    globbing support:
        trie context:
            [] fnmatch
        'mixed' context:
        during extractions, appends etc.
        [x] decorator provides arity / 'types'?
        [] glob.glob
'real' effects:
    delegate parsing to shell
    [] cd
    [x] shell runs

operations:
    [x] Opening files/dirs 'readonly'
    [] multiple files, append?
    [] perms: chown, chmod, chgrp(?)
    [] editing: edit, mv, rm, add
    [x] lazy TemporaryDirectory?
    might get complicated tracking changes
    [] heterogenous trie values?

add:
    [] create temporary; either duplicate name or extension preserving
    [] load tmp into $EDITOR, overridable?
    [] keep tmp until making changes, or commit to BytesIO/TarInfo?
