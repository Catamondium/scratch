parsing:
    globbing support:
        tar context:
            [] fnmatch
        'mixed' context (during extractions, appends etc.):
            [] decorator provides arity / 'types'?
            [] glob.glob
'real' effects: delegate parsing to shell:
    [] cd
    [] shell runs

operations:
    [] multiple files, append?
    [] perms: chown, chmod, chgrp(?)
    [] editing: edit, mv, rm, add
    [] lazy TemporaryDirectory?
    might get complicated tracking changes:
        [] heterogenous trie values?

add:
    [] create temporary; either duplicate name or extension preserving
    [] load tmp into $EDITOR, overridable?
    [] keep tmp until making changes, or commit to BytesIO/TarInfo?
