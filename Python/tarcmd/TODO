'real' effects:
    delegate parsing to shell
    [] !cd
    [x] shell runs

operations:
    [x] Opening files/dirs 'readonly'
    mass addition, possibly delayable
    [] multiple files, append?
    [/] perms: chown, chmod, chgrp(?) circumventable
    editing:
        [/] edit // natural component?
        immediate commit, requires metadata mutation
        [] mv
        also immediate commit
        [] rm
        delayable, but trackable like that?
        [] add
    [x] lazy TemporaryDirectory?
    might get complicated tracking changes
    could just, not do
    [] heterogenous trie values?
        tracking adds?
        'extract -> fetch' semantic change

lets see if `TarFile.add` overwrites first
//add:
//    [] create temporary; either duplicate name or extension preserving
//    [] load tmp into $EDITOR, overridable?
//    [] keep tmp until making changes, or commit to BytesIO/TarInfo?
